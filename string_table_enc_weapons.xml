		<text>An offensive hand grenade with a small kill zone of 5 meters. Often used by stalkers to "smoke out" mutants due to its relatively low cost.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-abakan">
		<text>A modern assault rifle developed as a replacement for the aging AK-74. The main difference is its high speed 2-round burst firing mode, which allows two bullets to be fired at exactly the same spot on a target up to 100 meters away. This significantly increases the likelihood of hitting the target in comparison to the 1 round firing mode, which considerably improves kill potential, stopping power and armor piercing capability.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-abakan_m1">
		<text>Machine gun supplied with a modified optic sight for carrying out sniper fire. The optics embedded into the body of the weapon has a higher resolution than the standard model.</text>

		<text>An effective silencer which can be modified on the go as required. The body of the silencer around the barrel contains a roll of fine brass mesh, while the front comprises a set of metal diaphragms with holes for the bullet to pass through. The set includes adaptors and sealants for most weapons. Normally used to thin out enemy ranks without drawing attention.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-ak74">
		<text>This weapon, designed in 1974, signaled the adoption of small caliber and low impulse rounds by Warsaw Pact countries. A descendant of the most popular assault rifle in the world, the AKS-74 has an even bigger muzzle brake, resulting in a reduction of what was already manageable recoil. This facilitates better accuracy and groupings, especially when fired in fast single shots or bursts. As before, the rifle is very simple and reliable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-ak74_m1">
		<text>The modified closing system increases the speed of shooting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-ak74u">
		<text>Despite being similar to submachineguns in size, weight and tactical purpose, this weapon is classified as an assault rifle due to the fact that its internal mechanism is identical to that of the AK-74. The weapon is notable for its mobility in close quarters and high armor-penetration capacity, while its drawbacks are its short effective range, despite the relatively long bullet range, a tendency to overheat and high ricochet propensity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-ak74u_m1">
		<text>Enhanced machine gun. Comes with a non-replaceable silencer.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Beretta pistols enjoy the reputation of a relatively reliable, albeit somewhat cumbersome weapon, around the world. In service with armed forces and police across the ocean, as well as various military and law enforcement organizations worldwide. The pistol is equally popular with members of the underworld, thanks to its powerful round and magazine capacity. Berettas found in the Zone are usually dated, probably from retired stock.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-bm16">
		<text>A sawed-off TOZ-66 hunting shotgun with two side-by-side barrels, making it lighter and more compact than a full shotgun. One of the most popular weapons among bandits due to its combination of ease of concealment and extreme effectiveness in close combat.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-colt_m1">
		<text>A weapon for hired assassins. This reliable Colt M1911 pistol comes with a non-replaceable silencer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-colt1911">
		<text>A classic automatic pistol, which passed all the major armed conflicts of the 20th century with flying colors and entered the new millennium with confidence. Produced by dozens if not hundreds of arms manufacturers around the world in both standard and modified configurations. The weapon's only drawback, its mediocre magazine capacity, is largely compensated by the hard-hitting ammo it uses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-desert-eagle">
		<text>The ultimate hand cannon - bulky, heavy and highly lethal. Developed as a specialized weapon for hunting medium-sized and large game, as well as for shooting competitions involving firing at steel body targets at distances over 50 meters. Its limited use in the Zone can be attributed to its price, size and weight, which are all double those of other pistols.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-eagle_m1">
		<text>A gun that is already powerful, reworked to fit rifle bullets. Truly a killing machine for close-range combat.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-fn2000">
		<text>This futuristic-looking weapon with a bullpup layout is actually a mass produced modular system, comprising a rifle grenade complex with a computerized fire control system and a 40-mm grenade launcher. Despite its bulky appearance, the weapon is highly ergonomic, easy to use and benefits from good technical characteristics.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-fort">
		<text>A Ukranian-made pistol predominantly used by law enforcement organizations. Provides higher accuracy, better ergonomics and has a larger magazine than the Makarov PM. These pistols make it into the Zone in large numbers thanks to the sale of defective weapons, which suffer from technical miscalculations in early design models. Despite this, the pistol is in demand among stalkers thanks to its good combat characteristics.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-fort_m1">
		<text>This Fort pistol is a experimental prototype. It's larger and more powerful than its predecessor, and it has a larger magazine capacity due to the fact that its magazine design is inspired by the Glock's.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-g36">
		<text>A new addition to the Western-made assault rifle family, which differs significantly from previous models in the series built on an automatic foundation with a semi-open bolt assembly, this weapon is more like American automatic gas-operated assault rifles with a short-stroke gas piston system. These changes ensure that the rifle is a first-rate example of a modern weapon - lightweight, reliable and ergonomic.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-gauss">
		<text>A super-accurate high-tech weapon, this rifle was developed in secret laboratories located inside the Zone. The weapon operates by accelerating bullets to extremely high speeds using a system of electromagnets, which provides incredible stopping power with virtually no recoil. The weapon is powered by using encapsulated artifact fragments in the batteries.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-groza">
		<text>This assault rifle combined with a grenade launcher, which is similar to the AK series, was specifically developed for rapid response units. The main differences are its 9x39 caliber ammunition, bullpup layout and extensive configuration options. This weapon is highly valued by military stalkers due to its ability to kill enemies wearing body armor behind improvised cover at a distance during urban combat, as well as its excellent stopping power.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-groza_m1">
		<text>This Groza has been modified to use 5.45mm rounds. Rechambering a rifle like this would take talent; one of the stalker craftsmen who lives in the Zone was able to rechamber this weapon so that it accepts the more common 5.45mm round.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-hpsa">
		<text>A modified model of a pistol from the first half of the 20th century, which is as reliable, powerful and accurate as the original. Pistols of this series deserve their reputation as one of the best handguns of the 20th century and are in great demand in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-knife">
		<text>Knife</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-l85">
		<text>This rifle's considerable number of drawbacks caused most of these weapons to be modernized, with the retired stock making its way to the Zone via the black market. The rifle's main advantages are its built-in 4x scope, high single-shot accuracy and reliable upgrade technology. When the weapon is fired in bursts, its accuracy decreases significantly and the rifle's basic internal mechanisms become somewhat unreliable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-l85_m1">
		<text>This L85 has been improved with a with a few modifications, giving it a better recoil impulse and better reliability.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-l85_m2">
		<text>This L85 comes with an integrated silencer. Many of its parts have been replaced with lighter ones, which makes the weapon significantly lighter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-lr300">
		<text>A new step in the development of the M16's family weapon family. The changes were made to the upper half of the steel construction comprising the barrel, gas tube and bolt assembly, reducing the weapon's weight, improving ergonomics and its gas system. The weapon is highly accurate, although its propensity to catch dirt makes it a poor choice for the Zone's difficult conditions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-lr300_m1">
		<text>A modified LR-300. It can only fire in semi-auto, but it has better accuracy. It can be assumed that this weapon was going to be used as a cheap analog for a sniper rifle.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-mp5">
		<text>This submachine gun has gained popularity around the world thanks to its reliability, ease of use and accuracy. Over the last few decades the MP5 was in service with special armed forces and police units worldwide. Not surprisingly, having flooded the global black markets, it eventually made its way to the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-mp5_m1">
		<text>Light, compact, and rechambered to accept the more widespread 9x18mm round, this submachinegun is a great find for novice stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-mp5_m2">
		<text>A modified variant of the MP5 that has a non-replaceable silencer attached.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-pb">
		<text>This pistol was developed in the second half of the 20th century on the basis of the Makarov PM for use by special forces and scouting units. The front of the pistol's barrel is covered with an integrated silencer, while the bolt mechanism is short, which prevents a back-moving spring from being located inside it, and it is therefore situated in the weapon's handle. Morally obsolete, the weapon is still effective in the right hands.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-pm">
		<text>This Soviet legacy is the most common pistol in the Zone and is one of the best compact self-defense handguns available. It is small, highly reliable, easy to use and maintain in working order. It also suffers from several drawbacks, including its short range, low firing accuracy and poor stopping power, while also losing out to modern pistols in its class in terms of weight and magazine size.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-rg-6">
		<text>This revolver-type grenade launcher uses six rifled front-loading barrels, identical to underbarrel launcher attachments. The drum is also front-loading. Widely used for rapid suppression of enemy firing position and, when in the open, attacking defended fixed targets or fighting particularly tough monsters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-rg6_m1">
		<text>A variant of the RG-6 revolver-type grenade launcher. It has been modified to use M209 rounds instead of the VOG-25 round.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-rpg7">
		<text>This grenade launcher from the 1960s made its way into the Zone from army depots. The weapon is a smoothbore single-shot recoilless launch system with an open-rear tube. Comes with a PGO-7 x2.7 optical scope. Although its huge size and weight make it an unlikely choice for stalkers, given its huge destructive power and ease of use, it has found admirers in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-sig_m1">
		<text>The weapon was modified so that it's more viable for close-quarters combat in a city. To lessen the weight, some parts were removed or replaced. As a result, there is no way to attach neither a sight nor a grenade launcher under the barrel. But at least it weighs almost half of what it did before.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_weapons1_wpn-sig_m2">
		<text>This rifle has been modified so that it performs more like a sniper rifle. It's furnished with a non-removeable optical sight that has modified, increasing its magnification.</text>
